These are the projects I am actively working on or maintaining

## [Must Watch (Android)](https://github.com/Kyle-Falconer/Must-Watch-Android)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Kyle-Falconer/Must-Watch-Android/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Kyle-Falconer/Must-Watch-Android/tree/master)
[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/e4ed5d2e79273bed/status.svg?token=3ePaSPJ6p4PcBNwHBXsMwA&branch=master)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/e4ed5d2e79273bed)

Currently a work in progress, the goal is to be a mead-making helper app for Android.

If you're intrested in learning how to brew mead, check out [the mead subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead).

This app is being designed to make mead-making easier, from recipie creation, to calculations and reminders about when to perform certain tasks. Let me know if you're interested in beta testing the app!

## [BadgeHub](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/BadgeHub)
Badge printing application for Raspberry Pi that logs user information such as name and email and prints a name badge and QR code associated with that information.

Features include:
* DYMO LabelWriter integration
* Google Sheets upload
* NFC reader integration
* full customizability with the administration page

## [DYMO SDK for Linux](https://github.com/Kyle-Falconer/DYMO-SDK-for-Linux)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Kyle-Falconer/DYMO-SDK-for-Linux/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Kyle-Falconer/DYMO-SDK-for-Linux/tree/master)

Community-maintained drivers for the DYMO LabelWriter printers. DYMO no longer supports Linux, so this is a fork of the official [DYMO SDK for Linux](http://www.dymo.com/en-US/dymo-label-sdk-and-cups-drivers-for-linux-dymo-label-sdk-cups-linux-p--1), updated so that it compiles with CUPS version 2 or higher.
