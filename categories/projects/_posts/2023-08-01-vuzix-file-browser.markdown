Redesigned and simplified the Android Open Source Project’s DocumentsUI app to serve as the new File Browser for [Vuzix Smart Glasses](https://www.vuzix.com/), enhancing user experience and maintainability. The project directive was to re-imagine the user interface and make the code easier to maintain in the future. This included removing unnecessary components, like the side navigation drawer, and optimizing the interface to work with touchbar navigation. The project involved over 15,000 lines of code changes, incorporating both Java and Kotlin. As the sole contributor, I oversaw the entire development process, from initial design to final implementation, significantly improving the device’s usability and accessibility. I used a combination of Java and Kotlin for this project, and a large majority of the app was converted to Kotlin over the course of the project.
