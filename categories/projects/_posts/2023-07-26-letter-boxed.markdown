The New York Times has a puzzle in their NYT Games called [Letter Boxed][1]. This program is a solution finder for that game.

This project came about as a reult of [nerd sniping][3] myself in trying to find a generic solution for any given Letter Boxed puzzle. I chose to implement the program in Kotlin, using Coroutines for multi-threading.

I ended up using this project source code as case study in the Kotlin training course I hosted while at Vuzix.
