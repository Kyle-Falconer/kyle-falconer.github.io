Swathi and I have solidified our travel plans beyond Hyderabad. In a nutshell, we are leaving tonight for Hyderabad, visiting with her parents for a few days, then flying round trip to Delhi on the 26th. After touristing about, we return to Hyderabad in time to bus to Goa on the 31st (Happy Birthday, Mom!). After admiring the beaches and local scenery, we will be bussing back to Bangalore on the 5th.

Wish us a safe and happy journey.
