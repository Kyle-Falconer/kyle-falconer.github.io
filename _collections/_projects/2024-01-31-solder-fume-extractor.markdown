My version of the solder fume extractor, attempting to bring the best in portability for soldering:

* fume mitigation with the widely-available [Weller WSA350F Carbon Filter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EJ1BUU)
* USB PD to power soldering irons such as the [TS80P](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Original-Programmable-Portable-Electric/dp/B0B9MR5PM4/)/[TS101](https://www.amazon.com/UY-CHAN-Programmable-Pocket-size-Acceleration/dp/B01MD12DYT?th=1)/[Pinecil](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/)
* cordless and rechargeable power supply using the widely-available Ryobi ONE+ 18v battery packs
* voltage conversion to power a typical 140mm PC fan
* the Ryobi battery serves double-duty, providing a stabilizing mass as the base of the fan
* a large hinge allows for tilting the fan for optimal positioning
the filter enclosure is able to be easily opened, allowing for easy replacement of the carbon filter when needed
* a hexagon grid pattern is used for style and functionality as the mesh pattern, the small hexagons are intended to keep tiny fingers safe
