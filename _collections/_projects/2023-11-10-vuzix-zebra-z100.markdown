Over the course of a couple months, I developed an application to demonstrate what warehouse operations would look like when using a Zebra handheld barcode scanner ([TC52][1] and [WS50][2]) with the new [Vuzix Z100 Smart Glasses][3].

Initially conceived as a tech demo to validate the concept, the project rapidly expanded into a fully-featured warehouse picking application to highlight how the Z100 Smart Glasses could be used to improve safety and speed in the warehouse.

Implemented in Kotlin using the latest best practices, [Zebra's DataWedge API][4], the [Vuzix Ultralite SDK][5] and backed by a [state machine](https://github.com/Tinder/StateMachine) to model the picking flow, this app rapidly went through several rounds of iterations between myself, Vuzixâ€™s Software Director, the CEO, and industry experts. The outcome of this collaboration and rapid prototyping resulted in a polished demonstration of the Z100 Smart Glasses and was demoed at CES 2024.
