Currently a work in progress, the goal is to be a mead-making helper app for Android.

If you're intrested in learning how to brew mead, check out [the mead subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mead).

This app is being designed to make mead-making easier, from recipie creation, to calculations and reminders about when to perform certain tasks. Let me know if you're interested in beta testing the app!
