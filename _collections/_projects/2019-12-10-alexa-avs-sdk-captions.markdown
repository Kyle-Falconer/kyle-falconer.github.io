Added captions support for Alexa's voice, making the service more accessible to deaf and hard of hearing users. Adding this feature to the AVS SDK enabled third-party device developers to add captions support to their products. This work, written in C++11, is part of the open-source Alexa Voice Service SDK available on GitHub. I was responsible for the design and implementation of the feature, from start to finish. Developing this feature required me to learn and become proficient in C++.

The project code can be found on the [AVS SDK GitHub](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/tree/master/Captions)
